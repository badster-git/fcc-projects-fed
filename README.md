## Responsive Web Design

### Tribute Page
   This tribute page was made using HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The font used in this project is [Playfair Display](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Playfair+Display) and was imported from the Google Font library using a `<link>` tag. The page itself is formatted using a header and an `<h1>` tag for the title. `<section>` and `<article>` tags are used for the body. The main image is wrapped in an `<a>` tag that links to a Wikipedia page that goes into further detail about the main subject. The image itself contains an `<alt>` tag that follows the best practices for making accessible webpages. Margins, Flexbox's and media queries are used to make the webpage more responsive to different screen sizes. The image itself does resize but does not exceed its original size.

### Survey Form
  This survey form was created using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The font used in this project is [Inconsolata](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inconsolata) and was imported from the Google Font Library. This webpage contains an image that's set in the body section of the CSS using the `background-image` property. A small blur filter was applied using the `backdrop-filter` property and the image was set to cover to entire body section. The page is formatted using a `<main>` tag that wraps headers and sections. This webpage was designed as a standard survey form that contains specific questions related to the business. It will not submit unless the required sections are filled correctly. The age input will not accept inputs under 10 and over 100.

### Product Landing Page
   This webpage was designed and created using HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The fonts used in this project are [Poppins](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins) and [Lato](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato), both imported from the Google Font Library. This webpage uses a navbar that remains fixed to the top position that resizes and stacks the links when the page changes to a specified size in the CSS. The Get Started section embeds a YouTube video related to the product (in this case Bitcoin) using an `<iframe>` tag that initializes at 640x360. The text in this section contains uses margins and a block display that's wrapped in a Flexbox to allow for a more responsive page. The next section contains a 1x3 grid with clickable images that link to their specified site. The Markets section contains an embedded widget from [coinlib.io](https://coinlib.io/) which contains information about the current price of Bitcoin.

### Technical Documentation Page
   This page contains documentation for the Python programming language. I used HTML and CSS to create this webpage. The page contains a navigation section that directs the focus to specific sections in the page. The navigation bar has a fixed position at the left of the page but moves to the top when the window resizes to a width specified in the CSS.

### Personal Portfolio
   This webpage utilizes HTML, SCSS, and Flexbox. I decided to use SCSS for this project because I wanted the ability to use variables and `for loops` to help keep my CSS a bit cleaner. I also implemented a [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) style for the CSS to keep the code more organized. The `for loop` was used to iterate through an array of colors and set background color and font color for multiple elements via class. It kept things cleaner and allowed for quick color changes to be made in one swoop. I also utilized `@mixins` for box-shadows which kept the different vendor prefixed properties in one place and used arguments to set them all up, avoiding repetitive code. Media queries were also used to resize font-sizes and the layout of some sections. A grid was utilized to display projects and a small hover animation was used to fill the grid box when hovered. I used another small animation in the Contact section that smoothly moves the text up and changes the color when the cursor hovers over it. This was done using the `transition` property that transformed over the Y-Axis.
